4W and 1H:
  
  what :
  
    1. This Project is to detect small objects over long distances.
    
    2. It can measure distance to wide range of objects regardless of shape,color or surface texture.
    
  where :
    
    1. This Project is used throughout many applications and industries.
    
    2. They used in food and beverage industry to measure liquid level in bottle and in automated process.
    
  why :
   
    1. This Project is uesd to measure distances precisely and whenever these light strike a obstacle and return back in the form of an echo . Difference of outgoing sound and
    
    returning echo gives us the distance.
    
  when :
  
    1.This Project can be used at the time of loop control,robot sensing,tank level detection.
    
  How :
   
   1. This Project  will measure distance  by calculating the time taken by the echo signal to travel back after reflection from the desired target.
